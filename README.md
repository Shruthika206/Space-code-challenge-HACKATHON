## 🔭 Problem Summaries & Our Approaches

### 🪐 Problem 01: Exoplanet Orbital Period Histogram
- Analyzed confirmed exoplanets detected via **Radial Velocity** method.
- Created a histogram for orbital periods (0–400 days).
- Provided insights into detection biases and instrument limitations.

### 🌍 Problem 02: Radial Velocity Curve of 51 Pegasi
- Plotted RV data over time and estimated the orbital period.
- Performed **Lomb-Scargle periodogram** for accurate frequency detection.
- Folded RV data to visualize periodic star motion.

### 🌌 Problem 03: Pulsar Classification
- Preprocessed both numerical and image datasets.
- Built and evaluated:
  - **Random Forest & SVM** for numerical features.
  - **CNN** model for image classification.
- Compared both approaches on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

### 🛰️ Problem 04: Orbital Resonance (Theoretical)
- Solved for orbital periods using **Kepler’s Third Law**.
- Analyzed effects of 3:2 resonances on system stability and habitability.

### 💥 Problem 05: Escape Velocity from a White Dwarf (Theoretical)
- Derived escape velocity using conservation of energy.
- Expressed results in terms of **c (speed of light)**.
- Discussed implications for **degeneracy pressure** and **Type Ia supernovae**.
